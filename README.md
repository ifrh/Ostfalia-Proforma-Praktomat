This is the source distribution of Ostfalia-Praktomat, a simple
programming test runner for various programming languages.

The code is a fork (2019) from the KIT Praktomat (https://github.com/KITPraktomatTeam/Praktomat).
It adds the ProFormA interface (https://github.com/ProFormA/proformaxml) which enables Praktomat
to be used as a test runner backend in learning management systems.
Most of the unused code is removed in order to ease maintenance.  

The ProFormA format for tasks is 2.0 and 2.0.1 with some limitations.
The ProFormA format for HTTP request and response is 2.0 and 2.1. 

The code is running as a 'docker composition'.
Each testcase runs in its own docker container. 

#### Programming Languages

The following programming languages and test frameworks are provided with the ProFormA interface.

|  Language   |               Test Frameworks                |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------:|         
|   Java 21   |   JUnit 4.12/5, Checkstyle 8.23/8.29/10.1/10.17 |
|     C++     |            Googletest, Make/CMake            |
|      C      |        Googletest, CUnit, Make/CMake         |
| Python 3.11 | Unittest with Pip <br/>(Doctest preparation) |
|    SetlX    |          Simple test, Syntax Check           |


For running SetlX tests (https://randoom.org/Software/SetlX/) you need to copy the `setlx-2.7.x.jar` 
into the `extra` folder and rename it to `setlX-2.7.jar`.


For test specific information look [here](documentation/proforma/tasks.md).

#### Submission types

The following types of submission are supported:

* one single file (embedded or attached to request) 
* several files (embedded or attached to request) 
* zip file containing several files
* URI of SVN repository to export the submission from (credentials are stored in .env file)
 


## Installation

ProFormA Praktomat requires docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  

Each test run in its own docker container. This requires the user in the main container 
to be member of the docker group of the host computer. 
This is achieved by adding him to a group whose ID is identical to the ID of the Docker group on the host.

So you need to figure out the group id of the docker group on your computer: 

        grep "docker" /etc/group

Set this group id value in the docker-compose.yml file as DOCKER_GROUP_ID.

The file system used by docker should preferably not be "vfs" (virtual filesystem), 
otherwise the performance will be greatly reduced.

The file system can be determined as follows: 

        docker info | grep Storage


#### Configuration

##### Mandatory: Credentials

Create an .env file containing credentials and other private data. 
A sample file is included as .env.example.  

    cp .env.example .env 

Modify credentials!

Adjust number of workers to fit your hardware (e.g. WORKERS = <number of cores>). 

##### Optional: Change Locale

By default Praktomat uses German locale which results in German Checkstyle messages.
In order to adjust the locale settings, you can override the build argument LOCALE in the
docker-compose.yml file. E.g. for American English set LOCALE to en_US.UTF-8: 

    build:
        ...
        args:
            LOCALE: en_US.UTF-8

Note: This does not work at the moment with the supplied Java dockerfile.  

##### Optional: HTTPS
For enabling HTTPS (port 443) you must 

* `docker-compose.yml`: comment in `- /data/certs:/etc/nginx/certs` under `nginx`
* put your certificate files into `/data/certs` (or adjust folder name in `docker-compose.yml`)
* `nginx/nginx.conf`: comment in 443 configuration
* `nginx/nginx.conf`: set servername and adjust certificate file names  

##### Optional: Different Test Framework Versions

For using other test framework versions you need to modify the following files:
- URLs in Dockerfile (folder docker-sandbox-image)
- src/checker/checker/JUnitChecker.py
- src/checker/checker/CheckStyleChecker.py
- src/settings/docker.py

##### Optional: SetlX

The SetlX library is not installed automatically.
It can be downloaded from https://randoom.org/Software/SetlX/. 
The jar file must be copied into the `extra` subfolder and renamed to `setlX-2.7.jar`. 

#### Create Docker Containers

In order to build and start the docker composition simply run 

    docker compose build
    docker compose up
      
     

## ProFormA API (CURL)

<!--
TODO: The Web-Interface seems to be buggy.  

Then Praktomat is available on port 80 in your web browser:  

        http://localhost

For login see the credentials in your docker-compose.yml file (SUPERUSER and PASSWORD).

-->

The grading service is available on port 80  

        http://localhost/api/v2/submissions

A typical grading HTTP request in CURL is

    curl -X POST --form submission.xml=@submission.xml -F "{solutionfilename}=@{solutionfile}" -F "{taskfilename}=@{taskfile}" http://localhost/api/v2/submissions

with the following 'submission.xml'

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <submission 
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
        xmlns="urn:proforma:v2.1" xmlns:praktomat="urn:proforma:praktomat:v2.3">

        <external-task uuid="{UUID}">
            <uri>http-file:{taskfilename}</uri>
        </external-task>
        <external-submission>
            <uri>http-file:{solutionfilename}</uri>
        </external-submission>
        <lms url="{your URI}">
            <submission-datetime>{timestamp}</submission-datetime>
            <user-id>{user id}</user-id>
            <course-id>{course id}</course-id>
        </lms>
        <result-spec format="xml" structure="separate-test-feedback" lang="de">
            <student-feedback-level>{level}</student-feedback-level>
            <teacher-feedback-level>{level}</teacher-feedback-level>
        </result-spec>

    </submission>"

`submission.xml` can be transferred as a separate file or simply as data.
Files are sent as multipart/form-data. The task file can be a zipped file or a simple xml file. 

Note that embedding the student submission file(s) into `submission.xml` as `embedded-txt-file` or 
`embedded-bin-file` is also possible.

A sample for a timestamp is:

        2022-04-03T01:01:01+01:00


#### Submission with more than one file

For submitting more than one file you have the following options:

1. create a list of embedded text or/and binary files in the `files` section in `submission.xml`.
2. external-submission: set `http-file` as file name list (comma separated without blanks) and use standard file upload
3. external-submission: compress all student submission files to a zip archive (with or without package paths for Java) 
and set `http-file` to appropriate filename.

Sample for http-file for Java submission files list:

        http-file:de/ostfalia/sample/User.java,de/ostfalia/sample/File.java

You can also omit the relative path for Java source files:

        http-file:User.java,File.java

## Server sent events

In order to get progress information during upload and running tests another 
interface is provided. 

        http://{serverhost}/api/v2/runtest

Same as http://{serverhost}/api/v2/submissions but sends server sent events while running tests.

        http://{serverhost}/api/v2/upload

Same as http://{serverhost}/api/v2/runtest but does not run tests. Only the task is uploaded into cache and
a sandbox template is created if required for the programming language.


## LON-CAPA API

Since 4.5.0 an HTTP interface for the legacy learning management system LON-CAPA is provided. 

The URI is
    
    /api/v2/loncapasubmission

The following form fields are expected:
* `submission_filename`: Submission filename
* `task`: base64 coded ProFormA task 
* `task_filename`: Filename of ProFormA task

The student submission is automatically put by LON-CAPA into `LONCAPA_student_response`.


## Maintenance

The Praktomat stores tasks and results in a database and in the filesystem. In order not to
run out of disk space the whole system should be reset from time to time (e.g. before starting a new semester).
This can easily be done by calling 

    docker compose down
    docker dompose up 
  
There is no need to back-up anything!


Retrieve state information:

        http://{serverhost}/praktomat-info

Retrieve tasks overview:

        http://{serverhost}/tasks


From version 5.3.0 the docker compose file creates volumes for data and database. 
So data is persistent. If you want to cleanup data execute

    docker volume rm xxx_data_volume
    docker volume rm xxx_database

xxx depends on the installation folder (check 'docker volume ls'). 

### Software Update

In case of a software update this is the recommended process:

1. `docker compose down`
2. update software (e.g. `git pull`)
3. `sudo ./remove_migrations.sh` (delete old build files) 
4. `docker dompose build`    
5. `docker dompose up` 

If there are sandbox Dockerfiles to be updated all sandbox images can be recreated with 

    docker exec -u root -it praktomat3 python3 src/manage-docker.py admin_recreate_images

### Troubleshooting 

If you encounter responses containing errors like 'cannot allocate memory' then
you should try and increase one of the following values 

    TEST_MAXMEM_DOCKER_DEFAULT
    TEST_MAXMEM_DOCKER_JAVA
    TEST_MAXMEM_DOCKER_PYTHON

in src/settings/docker.py for your programming language. 
However, memory shortages can also lead to other error messages.
